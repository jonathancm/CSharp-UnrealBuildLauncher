# CSharp-UnrealBuildLauncher
Launcher app for Unreal Builds

# Jira Backlog:
1. Edit/Save/Load launch configs
2. Buttons to add/remove launch configs
3. Be able to bunch launch configs together into a "Recipe", so that you can launch a sequence like:
	- Build Platform X script
	- Launch Cook-on-the-fly
	- Wait X seconds
	- Launch game instance 1
	- Launch game instance 2
4. Collapsible Categories
5. Improve colors to make them more readable on dark background
6. Make an icon for the app
